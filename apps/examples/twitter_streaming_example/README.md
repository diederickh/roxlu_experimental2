# Twitter Streaming Example

This example connects to the streaming Twitter server and parses incoming 
tweets. Before you run this example you need to create an application through
the twitter developers website.

After you've created a twitter application copy the `bin/data/twitter-example.json`
to `bin/data/twitter.json` and copy & paste the access token/secret and consumer 
key/secret from the twitter developers page of your application.

_twitter.json_
````json
{
  "consumer_key":"",
  "consumer_secret":"", 
  "access_token":"",
  "access_token_secret":""
}
